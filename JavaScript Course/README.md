# JavaScript Course
The JavaScript course was my first initial immersion into learning the concepts of programming. I learned functions, loops, variables, naming conventions, commenting, and data types.

I then proceeded to use the concepts I learned from this course and applied them to HTML & CSS to create some user event-driven web pages with JQuery, AJAX, & React for my later assignments and projects in this course.

## Conclusion
The takeaway from this course was massive for my future endeavors. After taking this course, I now have the fundamental knowledge of how to create some minimal & simplistic programs using variables, loops, conditional statements, & proper naming conventions.
