			<p>&nbsp;An <span style="color:blue">Attack</span> potion is a potion made by using an eye of newt on a guam potion (unf), requiring 3 Herblore, yielding an Attack potion(3) and 25 Herblore experience. It is the first available potion to make with the Herblore skill. A dose of Attack potion provides a temporary skill boost to Attack equal to 3 + 10% of the player's current Attack level, rounded down. This is less than the super Attack's boost of 5 + 15% of the player's current Attack level, rounded down.<br> After Barbarian Herblore Training, roe or caviar can be added to an Attack potion(2), requiring 4 Herblore, yielding an Attack mix and 8 Herblore experience. An Attack mix has 2 doses, boosts Attack equal to 3 + 10% of the player's current Attack level, rounded down, and heals 3 Hitpoints if roe is used or 6 Hitpoints if caviar is used.</p>
